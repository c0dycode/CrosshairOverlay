# CrosshairOverlay
 Updated CrosshairOverlay for ReShade 4+, based on the "Layer.fx" shader
 I have only tested this with ReShade 4.3.0 on Apex Legends and it worked well enough for me.

 # Installation
- Install ReShade version 4+ and download the default shaders if it prompts you about them
- Download "CrosshairOverlay.zip"
- Extract it and place the "Shaders" and "Textures" folder in the "reshade-shaders" (or wherever it put the reshade shaders into)
- Done!

# Disclaimer
As always, I am not responsible if your game doesn't support ReShade or has it whitelisted and you're banned.
Use at your own risk.
